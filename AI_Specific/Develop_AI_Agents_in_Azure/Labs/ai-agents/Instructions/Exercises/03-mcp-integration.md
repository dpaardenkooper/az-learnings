# Develop an AI agent with Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools

In this exercise, you'll use the Microsoft Foundry VS Code extension to create an agent that can use Model Context Protocol (MCP) server tools to access external data sources and APIs. The agent will be able to retrieve up-to-date information and interact with custom services through MCP tools.

This exercise should take approximately **60** minutes to complete.

> **Note**: Some of the technologies used in this exercise are in preview or in active development. You may experience some unexpected behavior, warnings, or errors.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this exercise, ensure you have:
- Visual Studio Code installed
- An active Azure subscription
- Python version 3.10 or higher installed

## Install the Microsoft Foundry VS Code extension

Let's start by installing and setting up the VS Code extension.

1. Open Visual Studio Code.

1. Select **Extensions** from the left pane (or press **Ctrl+Shift+X**).

1. In the search bar, type **Microsoft Foundry** and press Enter.

1. Select the **Microsoft Foundry** extension from Microsoft and click **Install**.

1. After installation is complete, verify the extension appears in the primary navigation bar on the left side of Visual Studio Code.

## Sign in to Azure and create a project

Now you'll connect to your Azure resources and create a new AI Foundry project.

1. In the VS Code sidebar, select the **Microsoft Foundry** extension icon.

1. In the Resources view, select **Sign in to Azure...** and follow the authentication prompts.

   > **Note**: You won't see this option if you're already signed in.

1. Create a new Foundry project by selecting the **+** (plus) icon next to **Resources** in the Foundry Extension view.

1. Select your Azure subscription from the dropdown.

1. Choose whether to create a new resource group or use an existing one:
   
   **To create a new resource group:**
   - Select **Create new resource group** and press Enter
   - Enter a name for your resource group (e.g., "rg-ai-agents-lab") and press Enter
   - Select a location from the available options and press Enter
   
   **To use an existing resource group:**
   - Select the resource group you want to use from the list and press Enter

1. Enter a name for your Foundry project (e.g., "ai-agents-project") in the textbox and press Enter.

1. Wait for the project deployment to complete. A popup will appear with the message "Project deployed successfully."

## Deploy a model

In this task, you'll deploy a model from the Model Catalog to use with your agent.

1. When the "Project deployed successfully" popup appears, select the **Deploy a model** button. This opens the Model Catalog.

   > **Tip**: You can also access the Model Catalog by selecting the **+** icon next to **Models** in the Resources section, or by pressing **F1** and running the command **Microsoft Foundry: Open Model Catalog**.

1. In the Model Catalog, locate the **gpt-4.1** model (you can use the search bar to find it quickly).

    ![Screenshot of the Model Catalog in the Foundry VS Code extension.](Media/vs-code-model.png)

1. Select **Deploy** next to the gpt-4.1 model.

1. Configure the deployment settings:
   - **Deployment name**: Enter a name like "gpt-4.1"
   - **Deployment type**: Select **Global Standard** (or **Standard** if Global Standard is not available)
   - **Model version**: Leave as default
   - **Tokens per minute**: Leave as default

1. Select **Deploy in Microsoft Foundry** in the bottom-left corner.

1. In the confirmation dialog, select **Deploy** to deploy the model.

1. Wait for the deployment to complete. Your deployed model will appear under the **Models** section in the Resources view.

1. Right-click the name project deployment and select **Copy Project Endpoint**. You'll need this URL to connect your agent to the Foundry project in the next steps.

## Clone the starter code repository

For this exercise, you'll use starter code that will help you connect to your Foundry project and create an agent that uses MCP server tools.

1. Navigate to the **Welcome** tab in VS Code (you can open it by selecting **Help > Welcome** from the menu bar).

1. Select **Clone git repository** and enter the URL of the starter code repository: `https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/mslearn-ai-agents.git`

1. Create a new folder and choose **Select as Repository Destination**, then open the cloned repository when prompted.

1. In the Explorer view, navigate to the **Labfiles/03-mcp-integration/Python** folder to find the starter code for this exercise.

1. Right-click on the **requirements.txt** file and select **Open in Integrated Terminal**.

1. In the terminal, enter the following command to install the required Python packages:

    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

1. Open the **.env** file, replace the **your_project_endpoint** placeholder with the endpoint for your project (copied from the project deployment resource in the Microsoft Foundry extension) and ensure that the MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME variable is set to your model deployment name. Use **Ctrl+S** to save the file after making these changes.

Now you're ready to create an AI agent that uses MCP server tools to access external data sources and APIs.

## Connect an Azure AI Agent to a remote MCP server

In this task, you'll connect to a remote MCP server, prepare the AI agent, and run a user prompt.

1. Open the **agent.py** file in the code editor.

   > **Tip**: As you add code, be sure to maintain the correct indentation. Use the comment indentation levels as a guide.

1. Find the comment **Add references** and add the following code to import the classes:

    ```python
   # Add references
   from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
   from azure.ai.projects import AIProjectClient
   from azure.ai.projects.models import PromptAgentDefinition, MCPTool
   from openai.types.responses.response_input_param import McpApprovalResponse, ResponseInputParam
    ```

1. Find the comment **Connect to the agents client** and add the following code to connect to the Azure AI project using the current Azure credentials.

    ```python
   # Connect to the agents client
   with (
       DefaultAzureCredential() as credential,
       AIProjectClient(endpoint=project_endpoint, credential=credential) as project_client,
       project_client.get_openai_client() as openai_client,
   ):
    ```

1. Under the comment **Initialize agent MCP tool**, add the following code:

    ```python
   # Initialize agent MCP tool
   mcp_tool = MCPTool(
       server_label="api-specs",
       server_url="https://learn.microsoft.com/api/mcp",
       require_approval="always",
   )
    ```

    This code will connect to the Microsft Learn Docs remote MCP server. This is a cloud-hosted service that enables clients to access trusted and up-to-date information directly from Microsoft's official documentation.

1. Under the comment **Create a new agent with the MCP tool** and add the following code:

    ```python
   # Create a new agent with the MCP tool
   agent = project_client.agents.create_version(
       agent_name="MyAgent",
       definition=PromptAgentDefinition(
           model=model_deployment,
           instructions="You are a helpful agent that can use MCP tools to assist users. Use the available MCP tools to answer questions and perform tasks.",
           tools=[mcp_tool],
       ),
   )
   print(f"Agent created (id: {agent.id}, name: {agent.name}, version: {agent.version})")
    ```

    In this code, you provide instructions for the agent and provide it with the MCP tool definitions.

1. Find the comment **Create a conversation thread** and add the following code:

    ```python
   # Create a conversation thread
   conversation = openai_client.conversations.create()
   print(f"Created conversation (id: {conversation.id})")
    ```

1. Find the comment **Send initial request that will trigger the MCP tool** and add the following code:

    ```python
   # Send initial request that will trigger the MCP tool
   response = openai_client.responses.create(
       conversation=conversation.id,
       input="Give me the Azure CLI commands to create an Azure Container App with a managed identity.",
       extra_body={"agent": {"name": agent.name, "type": "agent_reference"}},
   )
    ```

1. Find the comment **Process any MCP approval requests that were generated** and add the following code:

    ```python
   # Process any MCP approval requests that were generated
   input_list: ResponseInputParam = []
   for item in response.output:
       if item.type == "mcp_approval_request":
           if item.server_label == "api-specs" and item.id:
               # Automatically approve the MCP request to allow the agent to proceed
               input_list.append(
                   McpApprovalResponse(
                       type="mcp_approval_response",
                       approve=True,
                       approval_request_id=item.id,
                   )
               )

   print("Final input:")
   print(input_list)
    ```

    This code listens for any MCP approval requests in the agent's response and automatically approves them.

1. Find the comment **Send the approval response back and retrieve a response** and add the following code:

    ```python
   # Send the approval response back and retrieve a response
   response = openai_client.responses.create(
       input=input_list,
       previous_response_id=response.id,
       extra_body={"agent": {"name": agent.name, "type": "agent_reference"}},
   )

   print(f"\nAgent response: {response.output_text}")
    ```

1. Find the comment **Clean up resources by deleting the agent version** and add the following code:

    ```python
   # Clean up resources by deleting the agent version
   project_client.agents.delete_version(agent_name=agent.name, agent_version=agent.version)
   print("Agent deleted")
    ```

1. Save the code file (*CTRL+S*) when you're finished.

### Run the application

1. In the integrated terminal, enter the following command to run the application:

    ```
   python agent.py
    ```

1. Wait for the agent to process the prompt, using the MCP server to find a suitable tool to retrieve the requested information. You should see some output similar to the following:

    ```
    Agent created (id: MyAgent:2, name: MyAgent, version: 2)
    Created conversation (id: conv_086911ecabcbc05700BBHIeNRoPSO5tKPHiXRkgHuStYzy27BS)
    Final input:
    [{'type': 'mcp_approval_response', 'approve': True, 'approval_request_id': '{approval_request_id}'}]

    Agent response: Here are Azure CLI commands to create an Azure Container App with a managed identity:

    **1. For a System-assigned Managed Identity**
    ```sh
    az containerapp create \
    --name <CONTAINERAPP_NAME> \
    --resource-group <RESOURCE_GROUP> \
    --environment <CONTAINERAPPS_ENVIRONMENT> \
    --image <CONTAINER_IMAGE> \
    --identity 'system'
    ```

    [continued...]

    Agent deleted
    ```

    Notice that the agent was able to invoke the MCP tool to automatically fulfill the request.

1. You can update the input in the request to ask for different information. In each case, the agent will attempt to find technical documentation by using the MCP tool.

## Connect an Azure AI Agent to custom MCP server tools

In addition to connecting to remote MCP servers, you can also create your own custom MCP server tools and connect them to your agent. A Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server is a component that hosts callable tools. These tools are Python functions that can be exposed to AI agents. When tools are annotated with `@mcp.tool()`, they become discoverable to the client, allowing an AI agent to call them autonomously during a conversation or task. In this task, you'll add tools that will allow an agent to perform inventory inquiries and recommendations.

### Create an MCP server with custom tools

1. Open the **server.py** file in the code editor.

    In this code file, you'll define the tools the agent can use to simulate a backend service for the retail store. Notice the server setup code at the top of the file. It uses `FastMCP` to quickly spin up an MCP server instance named "Inventory". This server will host the tools you define and make them accessible to the agent during the lab.

1. Under the comment **Add references**, add the following code:

    ```python
   # Add references
   from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP
    ```

1. Under the comment **Create an MCP server**, add the following code to create a new MCP server instance:

    ```python
   # Create an MCP server
   mcp = FastMCP(server_label="Inventory")
    ```

    This code initializes a new MCP server with the label "Inventory".

1. Find the comment **Add an inventory check mcp tool** and add the following decorator above the function definition:

    ```python
   # Add an inventory check mcp tool
   @mcp.tool()
   def get_inventory_levels() -> dict:
      # continued...
    ```

    This dictionary represents a sample inventory. The `@mcp.tool()` decorator registers the function as a tool on the MCP server, allowing the LLM to discover your function. 

1. Find the comment **Add a weekly sales mcp tool** and add the following decorator above the function definition:

    ```python
   # Add a weekly sales mcp tool
   @mcp.tool()
   def get_weekly_sales() -> dict:
      # continued...
    ```

1. Find the comment **Run the MCP server** and add the following code to start the server:

    ```python
   # Run the MCP server
   mcp.run()
    ```

    This code starts the MCP server, making your tools available for discovery and use by the agent.

1. Save the file (*CTRL+S*).

### Implement an MCP Client

An MCP client is the component that connects to the MCP server to discover and call tools. You can think of it as the bridge between the agent and the server-hosted functions, enabling dynamic tool use in response to user prompts.

1. Navigate to the **client.py** file.

1. Find the comment **Add references** and add the following code to import the classes:

    ```python
   # Add references
   from mcp import ClientSession, StdioServerParameters
   from mcp.client.stdio import stdio_client
    ```

1. In the **connect_to_server** method, find the comment **Start the MCP server** and add the following code:

    ```python
   # Start the MCP server
   stdio_transport = await exit_stack.enter_async_context(stdio_client(server_params))
   stdio, write = stdio_transport
    ```

    In a standard production setup, the server would run separately from the client. But for the sake of this lab, the client is responsible for starting the server using standard input/output transport. This creates a lightweight communication channel between the two components and simplifies the local development setup.

1. Find the comment **Create an MCP client session** and add the following code:

    ```python
   # Create an MCP client session
   session = await exit_stack.enter_async_context(ClientSession(stdio, write))
   await session.initialize()
    ```

    This creates a new client session using the input and output streams from the previous step. Calling `session.initialize` prepares the session to discover and call tools that are registered on the MCP server.

1. Under the comment **List available tools**, add the following code to verify that the client has connected to the server:

    ```python
   # List available tools
   response = await session.list_tools()
   tools = response.tools
   print("\nConnected to server with tools:", [tool.name for tool in tools]) 
    ```

    Now your client session is ready for use with your Azure AI Agent.

### Connect the MCP tools to your agent

In this task, you'll connect the MCP server tools to your agent so that it can call them in response to user prompts.

> **Tip**: As you add code, be sure to maintain the correct indentation. Use the comment indentation levels as a guide.

1. In the **chat_loop** method, find the comment **Build a function for each tool** and add the following code:

    ```python
    # Build a function for each tool
    def make_tool_func(tool_name):
        async def tool_func(**kwargs):
            result = await session.call_tool(tool_name, kwargs)
            return result
        
        tool_func.__name__ = tool_name
        return tool_func

    # Store the functions in a dictionary for easy access when processing function calls
    functions_dict = {tool.name: make_tool_func(tool.name) for tool in tools}
    ```

    This code dynamically wraps tools available in the MCP server so that they can be called by the AI agent. Each tool is turned into an async function that the agent can invoke.
    
1. Find the comment **Create FunctionTool definitions for the agent** and add the following code:

    ```python
   # Create FunctionTool definitions for the agent
   mcp_function_tools: FunctionTool = []
   for tool in tools:
       function_tool = FunctionTool(
           name=tool.name,
           description=tool.description,
           parameters={
               "type": "object",
               "properties": {},
               "additionalProperties": False,
           },
           strict=True
       )
       mcp_function_tools.append(function_tool)
    ```

1. Find the comment **Create the agent** and add the following code:

    ```python
   # Create the agent
   agent = project_client.agents.create_version(
       agent_name="inventory-agent",
       definition=PromptAgentDefinition(
           model=model_deployment,
           instructions="""
           You are an inventory assistant. Here are some general guidelines:
           - Recommend restock if item inventory < 10  and weekly sales > 15
           - Recommend clearance if item inventory > 20 and weekly sales < 5
           """,
           tools=mcp_function_tools
       ),
   )
    ```

   With these instructions and tools, the agent is able to invoke the tools to retrieve inventory and sales data, and then use that information to provide helpful responses to the user.

1. Locate the comment **Process function calls** and add the following code:

    ```python
   # Process function calls
   for item in response.output:
       if item.type == "function_call":
           # Retrieve the matching function tool
           function_name = item.name
           kwargs = json.loads(item.arguments)
           required_function = functions_dict.get(function_name)

           # Invoke the function
           output = await required_function(**kwargs)

           # Append the output text
           input_list.append(
              FunctionCallOutput(
                 type="function_call_output",
                 call_id=item.call_id,
                 output=output.content[0].text,
              )
           )
    ```

    This code listens for any function calls in the agent's response, invokes the corresponding tool function, and prepares the output to be sent back to the agent.

1. Find the comment **Send function call outputs back to the model and retrieve a response** and add the following code:

    ```python
   # Send function call outputs back to the model and retrieve a response
   if input_list:
      response = openai_client.responses.create(
            input=input_list,
            previous_response_id=response.id,
            extra_body={"agent": {"name": agent.name, "type": "agent_reference"}},
      )
   print(f"Agent response: {response.output_text}")
    ```

1. Save the code file (*CTRL+S*) when you have finished.

### Run the application

1. In the integrated terminal, enter the following command to run the application:

    ```
   python client.py
    ```

1. When prompted, enter a prompt such as:

    ```
   Show me the current inventory levels for all products.
    ```

    > **Tip**: If the app fails because the rate limit is exceeded. Wait a few seconds and try again. If there is insufficient quota available in your subscription, the model may not be able to respond.

    You should see some output similar to the folloiwng:

    ```
    MessageRole.AGENT:
    Agent response: Here are the current inventory levels for all items:

   - Moisturizer: 6
   - Shampoo: 8
   - Body Spray: 28
   [continued ...]

   Would you like recommendations for restocking or clearance? If so, I can check the weekly sales to advise accordingly.
    ```

    Notice that the agent was able to call the MCP tools to retrieve inventory and sales data, and then use that information to provide a helpful response to the user.

1. You can continue the conversation if you like. The thread is *stateful*, so it retains the conversation history - meaning that the agent has the full context for each response. 

    Try entering prompts such as:

    ```
   Are there any products that should be restocked?
    ```

    ```
   Which products would you recommend for clearance?
    ```

    ```
   What are the best sellers this week?
    ```

    Enter `quit` when you're done.

## Summary

In this exercise, you created AI agents that can use Model Context Protocol (MCP) server tools to access external data sources and APIs. You connected your agents to a remote MCP server hosted by Microsoft Learn Docs and a custom MCP server that you implemented. By integrating these tools, the agent was able to retrieve up-to-date information and provide informed responses to user prompts. This demonstrates how MCP tools can significantly enhance the capabilities of AI agents, enabling them to perform a wide range of tasks by leveraging external services and data. Great work!
